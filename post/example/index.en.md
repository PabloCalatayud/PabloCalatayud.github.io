title: Buy and Hold (BH) vs Dollar Costing Average (DCA)?  Another approach. The Dollar costing and public interest averaging (DCPIA)
description: When comparing DCA vs Buy and hold, two different situations are being compared from a capital resources perspective. In the buy and hold strategy, all of your monetary resources are introduced into the market, thus immobilizing them. However, in DCA, initially, a large part of your resources are available for use and they become scarce as time goes on.
