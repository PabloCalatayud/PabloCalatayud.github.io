# Freelance 

*Oct 2021 to Present*

I am currently engaged in freelancing activities via platforms like UpWork. My core expertise lies in the use of Python and its data science libraries for executing projects pertaining to finance and data science. Specifically, I specialize in the development, refinement, and testing of machine learning and quantitative strategies designed for investment in financial assets. Several of my models are available for review on my Github repository.

In addition, I have successfully implemented algorithmic trading strategies for multiple financial assets, which are currently in production. I deploy my robots on cloud computing platforms such as vultr.

If an exciting project presents itself, I would be receptive to the prospect of assuming a challenging position as a data scientist!


# Celestia Tech Group 

*2016 to Oct 2021*

I had worked as a software development engineer in the aerospace sector for more than 4 years. Most of my professional experience lies in MATLAB and PYTHON coding and developing models to calculate the radiation patterns of different electronic scan antenna geometries for different phase beam designs. I evaluated massive amounts of radiation patterns datasets looking for trade-offs based on aerospace regulations, client requirements, and engineering capabilities. In the words of the European Space Agency (ESA), “the project provided a high performance based on the state of the art of several key technologies ESA Project.
