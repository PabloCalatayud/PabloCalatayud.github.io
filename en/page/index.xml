&lt;p&gt;I had worked as a software development engineer in the aerospace sector for more than 4 years. Most of my professional experience lies in MATLAB and PYTHON coding and developing models to calculate the radiation patterns of different electronic scan antenna geometries for different phase beam designs. I evaluated massive amounts of radiation patterns datasets looking for trade-offs based on aerospace regulations, client requirements, and engineering capabilities. In the words of the European Space Agency (ESA), “the project provided a high performance based on the state of the art of several key technologies ESA Project.&lt;/p&gt;
